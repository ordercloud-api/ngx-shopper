# ngx-shopper

An open-source B2B ecommerce solution built on top of the [OrderCloud.io](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation) platform and maintained by the OrderCloud team.

This solution is composed of three applications which are all a part of **this** repo:

1.  Buyer - the entire shopping experience from the perspective of a buyer-user
2.  Seller - product management, order management and user management for your buyer app **(not yet built: see roadmap)**
3.  Middleware - a backend project that extends functionality not part of the core ordercloud api **(not yet built: see roadmap)**

The front end apps (Buyer and Seller) are written in Angular and the backend app (Middleware) is built with C#(.Net Core)

### Roadmap

The solution is currently very much under construction. Our primary focus will be getting to MVP. The following are an estimate of when the three main parts of the app will be complete:

- Buyer MVP: 08/06/2018
- Seller MVP: 10/01/2018
- Middleware: MVP 10/15/2018

- [Seller App](./src/UI/Seller/README.md)

### Contributing

We welcomes all contributions from anyone willing to work in good faith with other contributors and the community. No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.

Writing code may be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of contributing but there are so many different ways you can contribute even if you can't write a single line of code! Here are just a few:

- create an issue for bugs you find
- create an issue for possible enhancements
- write documentation
- improve current documentation

Issues are the primary means by which bug reports and general discussion are made. Please be sure to open an issue before you write any code with a detailed description of your problem or proposed enhancement. We may already be on our way to delivering what you want!

After you've opened an issue, received the green light to start coding, and have some code you'd like to contribute then you're ready to submit a pull request. We follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1.  **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2.  **Clone** the project to your own machine
3.  **Commit** changes to your own branch
4.  **Push** your work back up to your fork
5.  Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

Happy contributing!
