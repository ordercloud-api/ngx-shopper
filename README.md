### Building Locally 

1. Navigate to the project root with `cd src/UI/Buyer`.

2. If you have not before, install the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki) globally on your machine with `npm install -g @angular/cli` 

3. Install dependencies with `npm install`

4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Other Useful Commands  

*  Run `ng test --sourceMap="false"` from root to run all unit tests.

* Run `ng build` from root to compile the project without serving.

* Run `ng generate component component-name` from any directory to generate code scafolding for a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
